# LeapMotionSensor


## Requirements
Depends on:
- https://developer.leapmotion.com/sdk/v2 
    - Download link requires registration.
    - CMake find modules are smart enough to locate the SDK files in the usual paths. We recommend unzipping the `LeapSDK` folder in `/opt/LeapSDK` (make sure it contains `include/` and `lib/` at the top level).
